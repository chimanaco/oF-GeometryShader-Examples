# oF-GeometryShader-Examples

Examples for Geometry Shader with openFrameworks. I made this since I couldn't find an example which is built with GLSL #150.

## Installation

The easiest way may be using Project Generator. 

* Create new project with it and put files from a project folder(geometryShader150example only right now).
* Put a project folder into OF/apps/myApps/[your-project-folder]. Then import the project with Project Generator and update it. 

## Usage

Now only go with openGL 3.2 / GLSL #150, so set GLVersion to 3.2. I will make examples for other version later.

Tested with oF9.0 / Xcode 7.01 / OS 10.10.5
